		<h3> Renderer Behaviour in WINDOWS with and without webview being embedded </h3>
		<p> ( Note: MAC-OS exhibits same behaviour regardless on webview present or not ) </p>
		<p><b>"Crash Without Webview Embedded"</b> : Renderer turns white but background and application stays
			running we are able to detect and capture "crashed" event on BrowserWindowObject, hopefully atleast
			we can reload the application </p>

		<p><b>"Crash WITH Webview Embedded"</b> : Entire application is closed </p>

		<p> <b>Proposed Ideas : </b>
			<br>- Webview crash should not crash the BrowserWindow Render
			<br><br>- Any way to stop the webview crash event to cancel bubbling up, as all webview events go till 
			the embedder if we assume correctly, this might also be reason render crashing along with it. If in case
			webview crashes with any of the documented events like <b>"crashed","gpu-crashed","plugin-crashed"</b>.
			<br><br>- Function to simulate <b>webview.crash</b> instead or process.crash in this example
		</p>
